# Boil Step with Countdown Reminders

This adaptation of the built-in `BoilStep` allows you to set hops and other reminders with relative to the end of the boil. This is the opposite of the built-in `BoilStep`'s reminders which are relative to the start of the boil.

## Parameters

* `Hop Addition 1` to `Hop Addition_5`, `Prepare Yeast`, `Prepare Finings`, `Prepare Cooling system`, `Dose Finings`, `Start hot-side cooling loop`, `Prepare Fermenter`: how many minutes from the end of the boil to show the respective reminder
* All other parameters same as built-in BoilStep
